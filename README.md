# Numpy Implementations of Neuro-Fuzzy Networks (NFNs)

This code is my early attempt at creating neuro-fuzzy networks in Numpy following the approaches outlined in:

This repository is made publicly available for others to build on top of, but use with caution, as since this was my work from the beginning of my Ph.D., there may be mistakes as I was still learning about fuzzy logic at the time.
